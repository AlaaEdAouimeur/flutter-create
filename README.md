# Typer - Improve your Typing Speed.

![](prev.gif)

Submission for the FlutterCreate contest.

The application is created to learn to type faster. My goal was to add as many features as possible to squeeze it into 5kb.

## How to play
Just focus input and start typing.
Incorrect words will mark input red.
Correct words gives you points by the length of the word.
*Good luck!*

Try to beat your high score.

The application is inspired by Running apps and consists of a list of runs. I tried to put as much things in a single little app : custom animated drawing with animated paths, custom data, dynamic user interactions with a swipe that leads to run details (this allows for comparing details too).
